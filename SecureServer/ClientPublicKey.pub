28,
On server side, to realize client's string as rsa public key, do this:

A way,
> starting from "=", we have to read till "," to get the modulus.
> starting from second "=", we have to read till "}" to the publicExponent.
> however, this is limited wrt the fact that reading it will just return the same character and the character pointer won't be moving forward.

Another way,
> Knowing in advance what data to capture, we can set substring ranges to extract.
